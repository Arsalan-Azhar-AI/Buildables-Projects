## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Text Summarization Pipeline** that takes raw text inputs from multiple domains (news, abstracts, social media posts, technical documents, and creative writing) and generates concise summaries. The system is designed to be extendable, lightweight, and adaptable for various summarization use cases.

The goal of the project is to practice and showcase **NLP skills** in preprocessing, summarization, and pipeline structuring.

## 🚀 Features

* Summarizes raw `.txt` files into concise outputs.
* Handles multiple text domains (news, research abstracts, social, technical, creative).
* Modular pipeline – easy to add new text sources or summarization techniques.
