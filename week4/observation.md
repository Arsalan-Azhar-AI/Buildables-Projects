# Observations on Temperature Settings 🎛️

I tested the summarizer with **three temperatures**: `0.1`, `0.7`, and `1.0`.

## 🔹 Temperature = 0.1
- Very deterministic and factual.
- Summaries were concise, sometimes a little too rigid.
- Almost identical wording on multiple runs.

## 🔹 Temperature = 0.7
- Balanced output: clear but also more natural.
- Captured both key points and tone of the article.
- Best option for professional use.

## 🔹 Temperature = 1.0
- Creative and varied.
- Sometimes added extra interpretation or used more casual wording.
- Fun to read, but slightly less reliable for accuracy.

✅ **Conclusion:**  
`0.7` gave the most useful results overall.  
`1.0` was the most fun/creative.  
`0.1` was best for strict summarization.
